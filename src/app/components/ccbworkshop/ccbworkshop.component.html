                <b>The 24th Annual Workshop on Computational Cell Biology</b> will be sponsored by the <a href="
                https://health.uconn.edu/cell-analysis-modeling/microscopy-facility/" target="_blank">Center 
                for Cell Analysis and Modeling</a>, (CCAM) at the <a href="https://medicine.uconn.edu/" target="_blank">
                University of Connecticut School of Medicine</a> on February 13 – 15, 2023. It will be an intense online event designed to 
                enable cell biologists and biophysicists to develop models of their experimental 
                system using <a href="https://vcell.org/" target="_blank">Virtual Cell</a>, <a href="https://copasi.org/" target="_blank">COPASI</a>, 
                and <a href="https://vcell.org/ssalad" target="_blank">SpringSaLaD</a> software systems. The workshop will 
                include a combination of plenary sessions and breakout sessions for one-on-one model 
                building. For pre-selected participants, we will provide “hands-on” help developing 
                models in support of their individual research. Through the 3 days, there will be 
                opportunities for participants to describe their own modeling projects.
                <p>A separate in-person workshop is being planned for June 26 – 28, 2023, in 
                    Farmington, CT. More details regarding this event will follow.

                        If so, please send us a short (~ 1 page) description of your project explaining 
                        the research question you wish to address and how modeling can help.
                        This will allow us to determine if the current implementations of the Virtual Cell,
                        COPASI, or SpringSaLaD are applicable to your project.

                    <li>VCell and COPASI support many advanced modeling techniques. Please list any
