            <h1>National Resource for <br>
                Mechanistic Modeling of Cellular Systems</h1>
                <p>
                    This Resource formally brings together two foundational software packages, COPASI 
                    and Virtual Cell (VCell). The Resource will maintain and enhance these two 
                    widely used shared modeling tools. As the VCell and COPASI platforms were 
                    developed over the last two decades, researchers have come to recognize and 
                    appreciate the ability to explore quantitative experimental data within the 
                    context of specific mechanistic hypotheses and to use the predictive power of 
                    simulation for experimental design. Today computational analysis is a driving 
                    force in complex experiments while computational models are leading to the 
                    development of experimental methods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the years, the VCell and COPASI development teams have been committed to 
                    educating our user communities on the value of mathematical modeling and how 
                    to utilize modeling techniques in their research. In parallel, the team has 
                    been actively committed to supporting the expanding field of computational 
                    cell biology. Accordingly, we have created this Computational Cell Biology 
                    website as a source of information about cell biology modeling for the entire 
                    research community. Here you can find out about standards, other software 
                    tools and the many available workshops for in depth training throughout the 
                    year. Visit the links to learn more about <a href="https://copasi.org/"
