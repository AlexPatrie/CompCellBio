            <h1>Computational Cell Biology</h1>
                <p>
                The Computational Cell Biology (CCB) resource formally brings 
                together two foundational software packages, Virtual Cell 
                (VCell) and COPASI. The CCB platform will maintain and enhance 
                these two widely used shared modeling resources with the 
                research community.  As the VCell and COPASI platforms were 
                developed over the last two decades, researchers have come to 
                recognize and appreciate the ability to explore quantitative 
                experimental data within the context of specific mechanistic 
                hypotheses and to use the predictive power of simulation for 
                experimental design. Today computational analysis is a driving 
                force in complex experiments while computational models are leading 
                to the development of experimental methods.
                </p>
                <p>
                Over the years, the VCell and COPASI development teams have been committed to educating our
                user communities on the value of mathematical modeling and how 
                utilizing modeling techniques in their research. In parallel, 
                the team has been actively broadening the scope its user 
                community to a wide variety of cell biologists, thereby expanding the field of 
                computational cell biology.  In addition to bringing the teams of 
                VCell and COPASI together to ensure their continued success, 
                the CCB resource is committed to and focused on the 
                dissemination, training and outreach of mathematical modeling 
                resources for the growing cell and systems biology research 
                communities. The resource will lend itself to promote sharing, 
                collaboration, and support for standards in computational 
                modeling.
