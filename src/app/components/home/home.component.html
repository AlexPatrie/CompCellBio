                            The Computational Cell Biology (CCB) resource formally brings 
                            together two foundational software packages, Virtual Cell 
                            (VCell) and COPASI. The CCB platform will maintain and enhance 
                            these two widely used shared modeling resources with the 
                            research community.  As the VCell and COPASI platforms were 
                            developed over the last two decades, researchers have come to 
                            recognize and appreciate the ability to explore quantitative 
                            experimental data within the context of specific mechanistic 
                            hypotheses and to use the predictive power of simulation for 
                            experimental design. Today computational analysis is a driving 
                            n complex experiments while computational models are leading 
                            to the development of experimental methods.

                            Over the years, the VCell and COPASI development teams have been committed to educating our
                            user communities on the value of mathematical modeling and how 
                            tilizing modeling techniques in their research. In parallel, 
                            the team has been actively broadening the scope its user 
                            community to a wide variety of cell biologists, thereby expanding the field of 
                            computational cell biology.  In addition to bringing the teams of 
                            VCell and COPASI together to ensure their continued success, 
                            the CCB resource is committed to and focused on the 
                            dissemination, training and outreach of mathematical modeling 
                            resources for the growing cell and systems biology research 
                            communities. The resource will lend itself to promote sharing, 
                            collaboration, and support for standards in computational 
                            modeling.
